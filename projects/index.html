<h4>Projects</h4>
<p>Here's a list of projects I've initiated or contributed to in the past and present. I hope you enjoy.</p>

<h5>Past</h5>
<hr />
<a class="project-header" href="https://github.com/expresso-math/"><strong>Expresso: Hand-drawn math meets LaTeX</strong></a>
<p>This project was a collaborative effort with a good friend and classmate of mine (<a href="http://dbg.io/">Daniel Guilak</a>). Our intention was to develop a service (and client) capable of transforming hand-drawn mathematical equations to LaTeX code, for insertion to technical and scientific documents. Though ultimately unsuccessful in implementing the character recognition, we did succeed in building an otherwise complete system. Dan focused mainly on the CV and service interactions, and I was left to my own devices to implement an iOS app capable of capturing the user's drawn input and communicatin with said service. Take a look at the iOS app's <a href="https://github.com/expresso-math/expresso">repository on GitHub</a> to see that. It's been a while, so I'm skeptical as to whether it will work with up-to-date iOS devices, but it was a worthwhile project that really affirmed my desire to work in iOS development.</p>

<h5>Present</h5>
<hr />
<a class="project-header" href="https://github.com/josefdlange/doit"><strong>DoIt: stupid-simple task management on the command line</strong></a>
<p>This was a brief middle-of-the-weekend hack to build myself a convenient way to keep track of what I was doing while working in the shell. Context switches are tough on me, so if I can avoid switching from the shell, to a brower to-do, to paper to-do, to emails I've marked to-do, I can really stay focused and get my work done. It's implemented in Python and based on past work of <a href="https://github.com/mrben/bam">Ben Tappin</a> and <a href="https://github.com/holman/boom">Zach Holman</a>.
<br /><hr /><br />
<a class="project-header" href="https://github.com/josefdlange/CSRevealingViewController"><strong>CSRevealingViewController: An omni-directional swipe-to-reveal ViewController</strong></a>
<p>This one was a fun foray into programmatic AutoLayout constraints and animation. I think it turned out pretty well. Read <a href="/2014/08/07/WorkSpaces-and-CSRevealingViewController">this blog post</a> to learn more about it.</p>
