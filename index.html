<h4>{{ page.title }}</h4>

<p>Welcome to my personal page. My name is Josef David Lange. I'm currently a student of Computer Science and Theatre Arts at the <a href="http://pugetsound.edu">University of Puget Sound</a>.</p>
<p>Here I hope to share my ideas, my problems (at least the technical ones), and my solutions. It's also a good place to centralize ways to <a href="/contact">communicate</a> with me. Here and there I might add something fun, like some delicious food (well, not to eat, but at least instructions on how to make it).</p>
<p>I am currently working on the following projects:
<ul class="bullets">
    <li><a href="/projects/lendingshack">LendingShack</a>, a web application designed to encourage a strong community through the lending and borrowing of property.</li>
    <li><a href="/projects/boot">Boot</a>, an application for Mac OS X that allows users to quickly restart onto other startup disks on their Mac.</li>
    <li><a href="/projects/propr">Propr</a>, a web application for managing stage props in a theatre environment.</li>
</ul>
</p>
