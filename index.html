<h4>{{ page.title }}</h4>

<p>Welcome to my personal web page and idea archive. My name is Josef Lange. I am the CTO of <a href="https://snapship.it">SnapShip</a>. I enjoy working in and discussing topics ranging from software development, to DevOps, to theatrical performance, to how difficult it is to list one's interests on the internet, particularly how strange it is to attempt to sound clever in doing so. I also love to sound like a fool on the internet.<p> 
<p>Here I hope to share my ideas, my problems (at least the technical ones), and my solutions. It's also a good place to centralize ways to <a href="/contact">communicate</a> with me.</p>
<p>I am also an avid amateur chef, and hope to use this website to share recipes I've come up with as I come up with them. I'm terrible at recording my recipes, however, so don't expect a whole lot on that front, I suppose.</p>
<h4>Some recent posts</h4>
