<p>As a part of my graduation requirements at the <a href="http://pugetsound.edu">University of Puget Sound</a>, I get (got) to choose and work on a personal project that will hopefully serve as a demonstration of my gained knowledge while at school. Pretty neat. Considering I've learned something about everything from Algorithms to Artificial Intelligence to Graphics to Software Engineering to Database Management, it was quite a task to undertake.</p>

<p>I had several ideas along the way. Here are a few, and feel free to take them if you want (and I doubt you do, but who knows):</p>

<ul class="bullets">
	<li>Private collaboration web app (for short-term projects, not long-term like <a href="http://trello.com">Trello</a> or <a href="http://asana.com">Asana</a>, both of which I recommend).</li>
	<li>Software to better manage point-of-sale at large stores with several checkstands. Essentially smart people-herding.</li>
	<li>Aggregate recommendation engine</li>
	<li>Basic mechanical physics simulation software/sandbox</li>
	<li>Community-driven web app to nail down relative sizes of clothing. For example, relating that a Small at Old Navy might fit like a Extra-Small at The Gap.</li>
	<li>"Source Control" application for multi-faceted design processes. An example is the coordination of a production team (Director, Lighting Designer, Scenic Designer, Sound Designer, etc) in the theatre context.</li>
</ul>

<p>Those are a few. I eventually narrowed down to this other one, however:</p>

<ul class="bullets">
	<li>Math recognition through drawings. Touch interface</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, this has been done before. Several times, in fact, but frequently in a purely academic-only setting and years ago when paradigms of input weren't ideal. Not everyone wishing to input drawn math owns a graphics tablet, but nowadays a heck of a lot of people own an iPad, Kindle Fire, Nook Color, Nexus 7 or 10, etc. The Post-PC tablet is here and it is <strong>ubiquitous</strong>.</p>

<p>Expresso, the name of the client-side app, seeks to achieve just that, with a little help from additional software components Barista, Roaster, and Bean. I've worked on the project with a good friend, the kind gentleman <a href="http://danielguilak.com">Daniel Guilak</a>. The app is written for iOS and can run on iPhone, iPod touch, and most importantly iPad. Writing the client app was quite an experience for me -- I finally found a project I can sink my teeth into so deeply that I can comprehend Objective-C and Apple's frameworks. I've been trying to pound it into my head for some time now. Success!</p>

<p>As I mentioned before, the software is more than the client-side app. Barista is a RESTful API server that Expresso talks to, by uploading (POSTing) an image and asking for (GETting) the symbols in it. Barista in turn speaks to Roaster, via Bean (using <a href="http://python-rq.org">RQ</a>, a queuing app running on top of <a href="http://redis.io">Redis</a>, a NoSQL database software). Roaster uses <a href="http://opencv.org/">OpenCV</a> and <a href="http://pybrain.org">PyBrain</a> to do some image processing and then throw the data into a neural network (which, frankly, <a href="http://danielguilak.com">Dan</a> understands far more than me), which then spits out the estimated best value for each symbol in the math drawing!</p>

<p>That was long-winded.</p>

<p>This project is hard. We're still not done!</p>

<p>The next step is to relate each individual symbol in size and location to derive its mathematical meaning and then spit out the proper LaTeX or MathML!</p>

<p>Onward...</p>
