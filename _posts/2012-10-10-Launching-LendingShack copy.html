    Let me start this be declaring my point: <span class="strong">launching is hard</span>.
</p>
<p>
    Really, really hard. 
</p>
<p>
    But it's something every developer must do at some point, right? My good buddy (and a great developer) <a href="http://krwenholz.com">Kyle Wenholz</a> and I have been working on LendingShack since May of 2012. The project was conceived by some peers of ours in the Business Leadership Program at the <a href="http://pugetsound.edu">University of Puget Sound</a>. This project's purpose? To encourage 'collaborative consumption' in a community by providing an infrastructure for the lending and borrowing of property.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="http://lendingshack.com/">LendingShack</a> was a test of my skills, my patience, and my commitment. Never before have I worked on a project for so long. Here's the brief and probably-not-written-with-direct-quotes version of the story.
</p>    
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Kyle: "Hey, Josef, want to work on a crazy cool project with me?"</li>
            <li>Me: "Yeah, sounds like fun."</li>
            <li>Kyle: "Okay, let's master a programming language, learn a development framework, and do a barrel-roll through every difficulty we could possibly encounter!"</li>
            <li>Me: "Wait, what?"</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <small>* Not an actual conversation</small>

<p>
   Well, it was kind of like that. We knew from our previous experience in an Artificial Intelligence class that Python was pretty rad and perhaps we should program a large-scale program in it. Who doesn't love a language that throws semicolons and curly braces out the window? So, we decided on Python.
</p>
<p>
    Python proved to be a good choice -- it was lightweight and pretty to look at. But building a web app from the ground up in just Python would be obnoxiously long-winded, and why do all that when there are frameworks to do most of it for you? So, we went looking for frameworks. I initially wanted to go the direction of Ruby on Rails instead of anything on Python, so we dusted off an idea we had back when we were in a Software Engineering class for a web app we were considering then. <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Django is a pretty neat framework. It handles the hard stuff for you and gives you three places to put your stuff. Models, Templates, and Views. It's sort of an analog to Model-View-Controller. This was powerful for us. We spent some time developing what data we needed to store and how it would need to interact. That was pretty easy to put down into models and to (duh) model their interactions and dependencies. Views were the verb of the equation -- they do a lot of things, sometimes they don't even view anything. The templates is where I lived for much of the time. The frontend of LendingShack is templated using Bootstrap, which was a lot of fun to implement, and a lot of trouble.
</p>
<p>
    Sounds like it was pretty painless, right? Wrong. Talk about an interesting experience. It would take days to talk about all the big issues, but here I'll frame out a few:
</p>
<h6>Know Your Environments</h6>
<p>
    One thing I learned perhaps a little too late when 'mastering' Python was the concept of environment management. Instead of doing any of that, I just started installing packages willy-nilly and hacking this and tweaking that, without a care in the world. It became increasingly obvious that the system-installed distribution of Python (on Mac OS X 10.7) was not standard and was in fact the cause of many problems.
</p>
<p>
    On top of that, I didn't really grasp the power and the care required when using PIP. By a week or two into the project, I had probably PIP'd down a dozen packages at least and my development environment was a mess. I had import errors left and right, some things just wouldn't install, and life was just plain awful.
</p>
<p>
    "Why don't you just use a virtualenv?" Kyle asked. What? So, I spent a night or two learning about Python virtual environments. My life was changed forever. Now, I can manage multiple Python environments nearly without thinking and I haven't looked back. PIP is your friend. Use it wisely.
</p>
<p>
    Within a few weeks, we had built the skeleton of what would be LendingShack. Our data models were (mostly) sound and the interactions were sketched out. I was then able to work on the design more than the structure and came up with the site as you can see it today, utilizing <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a> and some other web magic.
</p>
<h6>Be Ready to Deploy When You Deploy</h6>
<p>
    Deployment was crazy. Like, really crazy. We assumed that because our code was working on both of our systems, one a Linux box and the other my MacBook Air, that it was pretty good proof that it would run anywhere. We, of course, underestimated the variance in stacks that could run Python and Django. We stumbled across <a href="http://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a> and had instantly fallen in love without looking to hard at other providers. The truth is there aren't many other providers that live up to Heroku's standards.
</p>
<p>
    That being said, Heroku was a big pain in the ass to work with. It was a whole new world of unknowns. Sure, we thought, we'll just Git-push our app up there an everything will work perfectly! Wrong! Multiple configurations were required, PIP freezing, and all kinds of other menial tasks. At some point, we had tried several different ways to get our app to 'know' whether or not it was running on Heroku, which would determine what settings it would have.
</p>
<p>
    This brings us back to "Know Your Environments." You really do need to. After some research and thought, Kyle and I realized (okay, this one was pretty much all Kyle) that both our local machines and Heroku could have environment variables set, so why not just have those set differently on either end of the spectrum? Locally we can have our app use certain values, and on Heroku use other ones. All of our problems with configuration seemed to disappear overnight.
</p>
<h6>Soft Launches Are Your Friends</h6>
<p>
    Never expect to be offline one day, then teeming with users the next day. I, deep down, had that desire, and was sorely disappointed. We gained a good handful of users, but our initial launch was actually sort of an incomplete product. "Real artists ship," Steve Jobs said. So we did, and it was together enough to work. We've made incremental updates and are nearing initial-feature-completion. The work we've done since the initial launch has been near monumental, and I'm very proud of it.
</p>
<h6>I Don't Care How Awesome Your Project Is, You Still Have Family & Friends</h6>
<p>
    There was a time when I was dangerously close to diving headfirst into LendingShack and practically cutting ties with a lot of my life by way of working so hard. This is bad. Really bad. I really think that time away from code is as important as time near it. Just always have something to record notes on (we all have smartphones now, after all), because I guarantee that next big idea will come to you when you're not sitting at your desk in front of your computer.
</p>
<p>
    I made sure to take breaks when I needed them. Sometimes this meant a half hour away from the screen, other times a half a week, maybe more. There are times when people need you, and people should always come before code. I learned, too, to treat my body well. It's amazing what an in-tune body does for the mind. Kyle's always been active and spent his weekends going on long runs, or obstacle-course runs with fire and 10k-volt wires. I'm a bit less of a mover. I got into yoga this summer, particularly Hatha and Vinyasa. What a difference it's made in my mind and my body.
</p>
<h6>Don't Plan A Major Life Event in the Middle</h6>
<p>
    So, I got married in August. It's easily the best decision I've made thus far in my life and I've not a single regret to mention. Well, this isn't really a regret, but more of an instance of hindsight. We'd been planning our wedding long before I signed on to LendingShack, so it's not like I could have said, "honey, let's just cancel the wedding, I think I'm going to be programming all summer."
</p>
<p>
    Maybe "Avoid A Major Life Event in the Middle" would be a better phrase. You can do it. Hell, I did it. Then again, I had Kyle there to pick up all the slack I left. Kyle's more of a day-by-day, steadily-paced programmer. I work in bursts. It's actually been a good team-up, I think.
</p>
<h6>Be Proud (You Worked Hard)</h6>
<p>
    Working on a project of such large scope certainly creates a sense of ownership. LendingShack, as much as the whole company has produced it, the web app is Kyle's and mine. Of course, not legally and I would never claim as such, but in our hearts its like a kid. I can at least speak for myself when I say I'm immensely proud of the work Kyle and I have done. Looking forward, we've got a lot of code review, clean up, feature enhancement, maintenance, and at some point I bet even a reboot. It's going to be fun, though, and I'm very excited for it.
