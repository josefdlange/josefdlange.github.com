<p>Told you I'd be back with something. It might have taken two weeks, but today I'm announcing my first <strong>twelve-hour-hack</strong> product. It sort of happened by accident, but I think it's pretty cool.</p>
<h2>DoIt</h2>
<p>DoIt is a nifty little Python-powered command-line tool that lets you log tasks, and then mark them complete. That simple. I find that switching contexts is the real time-waster for me, so if I can manage to keep everything in my shell--where I do 80% of my work--I can probably shave some brain-cycles of context-switching.</p>
<p>I've been crazy intrigued by modern tools on the shell (UNIX: It's not just for your 70-year-old CS professor anymore! Nor has it ever been, so stop it and get with the times, you functional-jquery-reactive-agile-bananacode hipster!) and was deeply inspired by <a href="http://zachholman.com">Zach Holman</a>'s Key-Value Shell Datastore, <a href="http://zachholman.com/boom/">Boom</a>, when I first saw it. Unfortunately I'm bad at the whole key-value information archival thing, so even though I gave it a good try, I was unable to really get into it. I'm no Ruby expert either, so I couldn't be bothered to tweak around with his code to get what I wanted. Thankfully, I stumbled across <a href="http://mrben.co.uk">Ben Tappin</a>'s Python port, <a href="https://github.com/mrben/bam">Bam</a>, and got hacking.</p>
<p>What I found, of course, was that I was trying to bend a tool that was way overpowered for my simplified usecase. What I did have at the end of this experience was a nice shell of a Python package, so +1 to me for finally understanding the construction of one. I borrowed some datastore and CLI input patterns from Ben's code and built up a really simple task manager. You'll probaby find some shortcomings of some sort in it -- and I hope you do! I'm very interested in refining this and making it a utility other people want to use, not just me.
