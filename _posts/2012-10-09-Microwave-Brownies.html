    Okay, you'd think a website hosted via jekyll on GitHub would be purely about programming and code and open source this and usability that, but the real secret is one of my deep passions is cooking. I like making brilliant cuisine, but I also can't help being lazy sometimes. This is the result.

    I didn't have any milk or eggs when I wanted to make these, so I experimented with some substitutes. I have to say, it actually worked pretty well. Turns out a tablespoon of cornstarch with two tablespoons of water equates to roughly one egg when baking, and a little bit of half-and-half watered down did fine for the milk. Weird, but acceptable nonetheless.
