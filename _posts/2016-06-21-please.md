I wrote this the other day on a dare from a friend of mine. It only works in Bash (and I use ZSH) but I think it's funny anyway. 

Just:

* Make sure you have [`bash-preexec`](https://github.com/rcaloras/bash-preexec) installed
* Put `.please.py` in your home directory
* Put the contents of the Gist's `.bashrc` in your `.bashrc`
