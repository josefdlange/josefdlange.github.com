    I didn't think I was going to start writing at all again. Of course, I was wrong. I have to have somewhere to put down the unimportant and non-groundbreaking things I think about, so that the myriad of people who need it so desperately will be able to find it.

    Okay, that's the end of the melodrama. I do like the concept of having a sounding board again for my little ideas and whatnot. What you can expect to find here:
    <ul class="bullets">
        <li>Software Discussion (both use and creation)</li>
        <li>Theatre Discussion (it's my second life)</li>
        <li>Odd and seemingly random wisps of humor</li>
        <li>Recipes to delicious food</li>
    </ul>
</p>

    As time goes on, I should hopefully be able to better collect my thoughts and better display them, but for now, this will do.
