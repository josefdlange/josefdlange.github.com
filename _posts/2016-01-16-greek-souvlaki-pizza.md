Pizza! Greece! What a combination. I'm participating in a Reddit community called [52weeksofcooking](https://reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking) -- every week there's a different theme in which you must prepare a dish. It can be the cuisine of a given culture, an ingredient, a method of preparation, or just about anythings food-related. In addition to the weekly challenges, this year there's the option to take on a "meta-theme" -- a year-long theme that you must fulfill in addition to the weekly challenege theme, all in the same dish.

I was really excited to do this. I love cooking and lately I've been strapped for inspiration. Once more, the internet pulls through in forcing me to try new ideas!

My "meta-theme" is pizza. This week's challenge theme was Greek. So I decided to make a Greek pizza! And not just any Greek-ish pizza with olives and feta, but a souvlaki pizza. And boy was it delicious. Tons of the credit for the idea behind this goes to my wife, Kate, who suggested the lamb souvlaki, helped me with a ton of prep work, _and_ made the tzatziki.

I really enjoyed making this pizza, so I thought I'd record a recipe of sorts (note that I'm no recipe-writer so a lot of the instructions will be more like: "uh, grill it for a while" and such...) and a gallery of the making-of process.

<h5>Ingredients</h5>
<ul class="bullets">
	<li>Lamb meat, in nugget-sized cubes -- trim off any excess fat</li>
	<li>Olive Oil</li>
	<li>A Lemon</li>
	<li>Cumin</li>
	<li>Paprika</li>
	<li>Oregano</li>
	<li>Fresh Thyme</li>
    <li>Eggplant</li>
	<li>Cherry tomatoes</li>
	<li>Red onions</li>
	<li>Kalamata olives</li>
	<li>Halloumi cheese</li>
	<li>Feta cheese</li>
	<li>Pizza dough</li>
</ul>

<h5>I. Marinade</h5>
In a small bowl, mix together a few tablespoons of olive oil and all the juice from the lemon. Add in a healthy but not excessive dose of cumin, paprika, oregano, and thyme. Add some salt and pepper. Throw in your lamb cubes and cover, and let sit a few hours.

</figure>

<h5>II. Skewer</h5>
With metal skewers, make little kebabs, or whatever you want to call them, out of your lamb chunks.

<small>(Oh, and at this point, light your grill and turn your oven as high as it goes. Throw in your pizza steel or stone if you have one...)</small>

<h5>III. Burst some tomatoes</h5>
In a small pan, throw down some olive oil, your cherry tomatoes, and some salt and pepper. Over medium heat, cook and keep 'em moving until they all burst and leave a nice juicy pan sauce. Take them off the heat an extract the tomatoes once cool enough -- reserve the juices.

	<figcaption><small>We went for a colorful mix, but any little baby tomatoes (grape, cherry) of any color (probably not brown or black) will do fine.</small></figcaption>
</figure>

<h5>IV. Eggplant</h5>
Slice the eggplant down to < 0.5 in slices. Grab some kosher salt and sprinkle liberally on both sides. Set aside in a colander over a bowl -- the salt will draw out a lot of the moisture that would otherwise turn the eggplant to mush.

	<figcaption><small>Looks like they're sweating -- I think they're nervous because they know they're destined to sit over hot coals soon!</small></figcaption>
</figure>

<h5>V. Grill your lamb</h5>
This was my favorite part. Throw those babies on the grill. We're not concerned with being cooked 100% through as a) it's lamb, and b) any excessively uncooked insides will be finished on the pizza. What we want here is some nice browning on the outside -- the maillard reaction! Once they look nice and seared on the outside, pull them off and take them inside. Slice each chunk in half or smaller for putting on the pizza.

	<figcaption><small>Mmm! Careful that you leave the skewers hanging a little off the grill so you have something to grab...</small></figcaption>
</figure>

<h5>VI. Grill your eggplant</h5>
Once your eggplant has sat for about a half hour, give them a rinse (the colander helps here) and then press dry with some paper towel. Don't be afraid to really give those slices the business -- they can take it. Rub the dried eggplant slices with some olive oil and pepper (there's enough salt remaining on and in the slices) and throw on the grill. Keep them moving and flipping until both sides have a nice browning to them, then pull them off and dice down into dime-sized bits. They should hold up to the dice thanks to the drying-out.

	<figcaption><small>Careful that when you flip, you flip perpendicular to your grill grates -- I lost a slice or two down the spaces between...</small></figcaption>
</figure>

<h5>VII. Assemble your pizza</h5>
<small>Oh, before this, shred up your halloumi, slice some nice thin slices of that red onion, and either put a rough chop on your olives or slice them into halves. If your olives aren't pitted, I feel bad for you son; I got 99 problems but a pit ain't one.</small>
Toss and/or roll out your dough. Throw down half the halloumi, then arrange your lamb and eggplant. Throw down the rest of the halloumi, and arrange the onion slices, tomatoes, and olives. Lastly, sprinkle some feta over it all and drizzle with that oil/tomato juice pan sauce from when you burst the tomatoes. Give a sprinkle of kosher salt and pepper.

<h5>VIII. Bake!</h5>
Throw it in the oven. If you are terrified of using a pizza peel, you should have done the prior step on a pan, and just put that pan in the oven. If you have a peel but are terrible at using it, I recommend checking out [this peel](http://www.amazon.com/Polymer-Sealed-Super-Peel-Pizza/dp/B00NGOOM6K/ref=pd_sim_79_2?ie=UTF8&dpID=41hxAdRogrL&dpSrc=sims&preST=_AC_UL160_SR160%2C160_&refRID=0PHXKVR43M22VTMGCBG4) or one like it. Just let it bake, and bake, and bake, until the crust is browning and the toppings look cooked. I could try to quote you a time, but its so heavily dependent on oven and ingredients and stone/steel that it wouldn't help you. Use your eyes and your nose. Pull it out when it looks or smells great.

<h5>IX. EAT.</h5>
Slice that pie up and serve with some tzatziki.

<h5>X: Postscript</h5>
I hope you get a chance to make this pizza. It was _seriously_ good. As far as the future goes, I'm looking forward to next week's theme: *BRUNCH*. I will also retroactively add the first two weeks' challenges: *soup* and *sous-vide* -- both resulted in fun pizza-oriented meals.
