    Okay, you'd think a website hosted via jekyll on GitHub would be purely about programming and code and open source this and usability that, but the real secret is one of my deep passions is cooking. I like making brilliant cuisine, but I also can't help being lazy sometimes. This is the result.
</p>
<p>
    I didn't have any milk or eggs when I wanted to make these, so I experimented with some substitutes. I have to say, it actually worked pretty well. Turns out a tablespoon of cornstarch with two tablespoons of water equates to roughly one egg when baking, and a little bit of half-and-half watered down did fine for the milk. Weird, but acceptable nonetheless.

    Here's the recipe -- it's simple, albeit a little messy.

<h5>Microwave Brownie Cake</h5>
<p>
    <ul class="bullets">
    Ingredients:
        <li>4 Tbsp Flour (All Purpose)</li>
        <li>4 Tbsp Sugar</li>
        <li>4 Tbsp Cocoa Powder (more or less to taste)</li>
        <li>1/4 Tsp Baking Powder</li>
        <li>1/4 Tsp Salt</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp Water + 1 Tbsp Cornstarch (in lieu of one egg)</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Half-and-half + 2 Tbsp Water (in lieu of 3 Tbsp milk)</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    <h6>Instructions:</h6>
    <br />
    <ol>
        <li>Mix everything together then pour into two ramekins or one big mug.</li>
        <li>Microwave for 45 seconds plus 15 second intervals until it (mostly) passes the toothpick test. </li>
        <li>?????</li>
        <li>Profit!</li>
    </ol>
    <small style="font-style: italic;">Note: Since there's no raw egg in here if you used the cornstarch, you can really pull it out whenever. If you want gooey battery cake, I'll look the other way. I would actually err on the side of undercooked so as not to make a chocolate-scented sponge (which could happen, you know).</small>
