    Enjoying mathematics has always been my dirty little secret, academically. There have been times math has pissed me off, but predominantly I love the discipline and practicing it whenever I can. Whenever I'm approached with something that math can be at least trivially applied to, I'm immediately crunching the numbers -- and it's fun.    
</p>
<p>
    Something we still haven't come to is a broad spectrum of applications for computers and mathematics in terms of hand-written input. There's <a href="http://http://detexify.kirelabs.org">Detexify</a> for detecting single LaTeX glyphs, and Wolfram Mathematica <a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/tutorial/HandwrittenMathRecognition.html">supports it</a>, at least in Windows 7. There are various unfinished projects attempting this, as well as a <a href="http://webdemo.visionobjects.com/equation.html?locale=default">demonstration</a> by a handwriting recognition software company. 
</p>
<p>
    All of these things are solutions, or at least partial solutions, which is great. I'm interested in producing an application based on sturdy technologies and open source libraries, that can run on multiple devices (iOS, Android, Win8 Phone, Desktop Mac & PC if possible) a lightweight piece of software that can accomplish LaTeX generation based on text input.

    This is pretty hard. Handwriting recognition itself is hard. I hope to make it simple by finding out a package with which to manage the recognition (character by character) -- my focus will be determining the intent of the relative positioning and size of the characters to match up to logical representations of mathematical expressions.
</p>
<p>
    It'll be a tough project, but I have high hopes. It's the kind of work that can start at a really trivial level and expand to more and more comlpexity. I'm thinking if I can get <code>2+2</code> to be recognized easily, then I'm on the right track.

    I will continue to update with progress as time goes on!
