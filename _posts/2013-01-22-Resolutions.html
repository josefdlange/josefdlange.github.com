<p>You <i>thought</i> I was going to be writing about getting a brand new MacBook Pro with Retina Display or something. Not so, unfortunately. Instead, I'm writing about the kind of resolution more people are familiar with. The New Year's variety. I've never really done New Year's Resolutions, so I decided this year I'm going to buy into it, but with a bang.</p>
<p>I can't take the credit for the idea. Instead, I owe it to a Reddit user, <a href="http://reddit.com/u/becauseisaidiwould">BecauseISaidIWould</a> and his Because I Said I Would campaign for the <a href="http://becauseisaidiwould.com/52weeks/">awesome idea</a>. The idea is simple. I'm going to write down fifty-two things I want to accomplish this year, all of which can be accomplished within a week, and then each week I'll pick one and do it.</p>
<p>I'm super excited. Here's a short list of a few I'm doing:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Run three miles</li>
	<li><del>Complete a whole Bikram yoga class, no breaks</del> Done!</li>
	<li>Turn my phone off for every meal, all week</li>
</ul>
<p>I have more, but they're not on the top of my head right now. I haven't compiled the whole 52 yet, so if you have any suggestions, please send them my way.</p>
